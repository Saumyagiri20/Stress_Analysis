# 😰 Stress Level Analysis using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to detect **human stress levels** using physiological and environmental data. By applying machine learning algorithms, it predicts whether a person is in **low, medium, or high stress** levels.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To monitor stress levels based on input data.
- To assist in mental health tracking using AI-driven predictions.
- To create a real-time stress detection system.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Model Used:** Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM
- **Dataset:** Stress detection dataset (physiological & lifestyle factors)

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Stress Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amandam1/stress)
- **Features:**
  - Heart rate
  - Sleep duration
  - Work hours
  - Activity level
  - Environmental factors
- **Target:** Stress level category (Low, Medium, High)

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
   - Remove null values, handle outliers.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize correlations, detect feature importance.
3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Normalize and encode categorical variables.
4. **Model Training**
   - Train multiple ML models and compare performance.
5. **Evaluation**
   - Use Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
